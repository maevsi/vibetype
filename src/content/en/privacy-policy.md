# Privacy Policy

## 1. Introduction

This website is operated by: maevsi UG (haftungsbeschränkt).

It is very important to us to handle the data of our website visitors with confidence and to protect them in the best possible way. For this reason, we make every effort to comply with the requirements of the GDPR.

Below we explain how we process your data on our website. We use language that is as clear and transparent as possible so that you really understand what happens to your data.

## 2. General information

### 2.1 Processing of personal data and other terms

Data protection applies to the processing of personal data. Personal data means all data with which you can be personally identified. This is, for example, the IP address of the device (PC, laptop, smartphone, etc.) in front of which you are currently sitting. Such data is processed when 'something happens to it'. Here, for example, the IP is transmitted from the browser to our provider and stored there automatically. This is then a processing (according to Art. 4 No. 2 GDPR) of personal data (according to Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR).

These and other legal definitions can be found in Art. 4 GDPR.

### 2.2 Applicable regulations/laws - GDPR, BDSG and TDDDG

The scope of data protection is regulated by laws. In this case, these are the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) as a European regulation and the BDSG (Federal Data Protection Act) as a national law.

In addition, the TDDDG supplements the provisions of the GDPR as far as the use of cookies is concerned.

### 2.3 The person in charge

The person responsible for data processing on this website is the controller within the meaning of the GDPR. This is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.

You can reach the responsible person under:

maevsi UG (limited liability)

Virchowstrasse 4 34121 Kassel

### 2.4 This is how data is basically processed on this website

As we have already established, there is data (e.g. IP address) that is collected automatically. This data is mainly required for the technical provision of the website. If we also use personal data or collect other data, we will inform you of this or ask for your consent.

Other personal data you share with us consciously.

You will find more detailed information below.

### 2.5 Yours Right

The GDPR provides you with comprehensive rights. These include, for example, free information about the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal data. You can also request the rectification, blocking or erasure of this data or lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority. You can revoke your consent at any time.

You can find out in detail what these rights are and how to exercise them in the last section of this Privacy Policy.

### 2.6 Data protection - Our view

Data protection is more than just a chore for us! Personal data is of great value and careful handling of this data should be a matter of course in our digitalized world. In addition, you as a website visitor should be able to decide for yourself what "happens" to your data, when and by whom. Therefore, we commit ourselves to comply with all legal requirements, collect only the data necessary for us and treat them confidentially.

### 2.7 Disclosure and deletion

The transfer and deletion of data are also important and sensitive topics. Therefore, we would like to briefly inform you in advance about our general approach to this.

A transfer of data only takes place on the basis of a legal basis and only if this is unavoidable. This may be the case in particular if it is a so-called Data Processor and a Data Processing Agreement has been concluded in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR.

We delete your data when the purpose and the legal basis for processing cease to exist and the deletion is not contrary to any other legal obligations. A 'good' overview of this is also provided by Art. 17 GDPR.

For further information, please refer to this Privacy Policy and contact the responsible person if you have any specific questions.

### 2.8 Hosting

When you visit our Instagram profile and interact with us, we process personal data. On the one hand, the data made publicly available on the profile. On the other hand, we also process the personal data contained in posts, comments or direct messages to us. Through interactions such as liking or sharing, we can see the user profile with the public information.

The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. It is in our legitimate interest to provide relevant and interesting content and to enable the use and functionality of our Instagram profile.

Insofar as an inquiry is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, our processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.

#### 3.8.2 Insights

As explained in the Meta Privacy Policy under "How do we use your information?" ([https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?entry\_point=ig\_help\_center\_data\_policy\_redirect),](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?entry_point=ig_help_center_data_policy_redirect),) Meta also collects and uses information to provide analytics services, known as insights, for site operators. This also applies to our Instagram profile.

Insights are summarized statistics that are created based on certain interactions of visitors with pages and the content associated with them and are logged by the meta servers. This includes the following information, among others

\-How many people see and interact with our products, services or content, such as posts, videos, Instagram pages, listings, stores and advertisements (if the advertisement is shown on meta-products);

\-How people interact with our content, websites, apps and services;

\-Which group of people interact with our content and which group of people use our services.

Meta provides us with summarized reports and insights that tell us how well our content, features, products and services are performing.

We do not receive access to personal data, but only to the summarized reports.

To evaluate the reach, we can make settings or set appropriate filters with regard to the selection of a time period, the viewing of a specific post and demographic groupings. This data is anonymized. It is not possible for us to draw conclusions about specific individuals.

The purpose of processing this data is to analyze our reach and adapt our content and advertisements to user interests so that visitors can derive the greatest possible benefit from them. By evaluating this data, we can recognize how our content, our profile and our advertising are consumed. This enables us to create target group-specific content and place advertisements in order to better market our company and our services.

The processing is based on our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.

When processing personal data in the course of the so-called Insights, the processing is carried out under joint responsibility with Meta in accordance with Art. 26 para. 1 GDPR.

We have concluded a corresponding agreement with Meta, which can be viewed here ([https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page\_controller\_addendum.).](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum.).)

Processing of personal data and cookies by Meta

When you access an Instagram page, the IP address assigned to your device is transmitted to Meta. According to Meta, this IP address is anonymized (for "German" IP addresses). Meta also stores information about the end devices of its users (e.g. as part of the "login notification" function); Meta may thus be able to assign IP addresses to individual users. If you are currently logged in to Instagram as a user, a cookie with your Instagram ID is stored on your device. This enables Meta to track that you have visited this page and how you have used it. Meta buttons integrated into websites enable Meta to record your visits to these websites and assign them to your Instagram profile. This data can be used to tailor content or advertising to you.

### 3.10 Google company profile

We have a so-called Google company profile. We use the information service offered by Google and the services of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland ("Google").

#### 3.10.1 Data processing by Google

The Google page and its functions are used under your own responsibility. This applies in particular to the use of social and interactive functions (e.g. commenting, sharing, rating, direct messages). When you visit and interact with our Google company profile entry, Google also records your IP address and other information that is stored on your device in the form of cookies. This may enable Google to assign IP addresses to individual users or user accounts. This information is used to provide us, as the operator of the Google company profile entry, with statistical information about the use of Google services. The data collected in this context is processed by Google and may be transferred to countries outside the European Union. What information Google receives and how it is used is generally described by Google in its Privacy Policy.

If you contact us via our Google company profile entry or other Google services by direct message, we cannot rule out the possibility that these messages may also be read and analyzed by Google (both by employees and automatically). We therefore advise against providing us with personal data. Instead, another form of communication should be chosen as early as possible.

The use of this service is subject to the Google Privacy Policy, which you - by using this service - have already agreed to.

Further information can be found in the Privacy Policy at the following link:[](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de.)[https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de.](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de.)

#### 3.10.2 Data processing by us

As the provider of our Google company profile entry, we do not collect and process any further data from the use of this Google service.

If you contact us or publish a review about us, we will process your published profile data and the content of the review/comment.

The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in presenting our company and enabling the evaluation of our services in order to present our company and our services to the outside world.

### 3.11 Third-party content

#### 3.11.1 Google Fonts

We have integrated Google Fonts locally on our server. Thus, despite the use, no data is transmitted to Google.

#### 3.11.2 Cloudflare DNS

We use the Cloudflare DNS service. This service is offered by Cloudflare Germany GmbH, Rosental 7, c/o Mindspace, 80331 Munich.

Cloudflare DNS provides protection against DDoS attacks and bot attacks and helps improve the security and performance of websites through global caching and a range of optimization features. For this purpose, Cloudflare receives data on the website accessed, the browser type used, the operating system, the referrer URL, the IP address and the requesting provider.

We obtain consent to collect this data. The legal basis is then Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. This consent can be revoked at any time.

Otherwise, the legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in optimizing and securing the content on our website in order to effectively protect ourselves against DDoS attacks and bot attacks.

#### 3.11.3 Cloudflare Turnstile

We use the Cloudflare Turnstile service. This service is offered by Cloudflare Germany GmbH, Rosental 7, c/o Mindspace, 80331 Munich.

Cloudflare Turnstile enables a CAPTCHA-free experience on the website. In addition, Turnstile prevents misuse and confirms that website visits are genuine. No data is collected for the retargeting of advertisements. For Apple devices with the latest macOS or iOS versions, validation is performed via private access tokens without collecting or storing any personal data other than user agent and browser properties, which means that no data is passed on to Cloudflare or third parties. For users of other devices, however, Cloudflare Turnstile collects personal data such as the IP address and shares it with the provider in the USA.

The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time.

In the case of data transfer to the USA, the standard contractual clauses (SCC) of the EU Commission apply.

#### 3.11.4 Polyfill.io

We use the functions of Polyfill. This is an open source community service.

The polyfill service provides code snippets, so-called "polyfills". A polyfill is used to implement modern functions in older web browsers, which they originally did not support, using alternative solutions. This provides a consistent experience when visiting the website across different browsers.

When our website is accessed, the browser downloads all polyfills that are required to successfully display the website in the corresponding browser.

For this purpose, technical information about the browser used is collected. In addition, connection information is recorded (IP address) and the URL of the website that requested the service. This information is not stored. However, an anonymized version of your IP address, the domain of the page that requested the service, the user agent string of the browser used, the polyfills requested and the URL/http method used to request the service are stored. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in making the site accessible for older web browsers. Further information: [](https://polyfill.io/v3/privacy-policy)[https://polyfill.io/v3/privacy-policy](https://polyfill.io/v3/privacy-policy).

#### 3.11.5 Gravatar

We integrate the functions of Gravatar on our website. This service is offered by Automattic Inc, 60 29th Street #343, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA.

Gravatar is a service that allows users to create a single avatar image and link it to their email address. This avatar image is then automatically displayed next to the name when comments are posted or articles are written on Gravatar-enabled websites, forums and blogs. Gravatar's main features include the easy creation and management of a universal avatar that is used consistently across different web platforms, making it easier for users to identify themselves and maintain a consistent online identity across multiple sites.

For this purpose, the e-mail address and the IP address are transmitted to Automattic's servers in the USA. Gravatar sets technically necessary cookies as well as cookies for analysis, performance measurement and advertising. The latter are only set with consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. Consent can be revoked at any time.

Otherwise, data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in giving users the opportunity to use the Gravatar functions on our website in order to ensure an unrestricted user experience.

In the case of data transfer to the USA, the standard contractual clauses (SCC) of the EU Commission apply.

#### 3.11.6 OpenAI API

We integrate the functions of the OpenAI API on our website. This service is offered by OpenAI Inc, 3180 18th Street, San Francisco, California 94110, USA.

OpenAI has focused on the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning. With the help of the OpenAI API, we are able to develop our own AI tools based on the databases and capabilities of ChatGPT/OpenAI.

All inputs in our tool are processed. Basically, these inputs, e.g. natural language, images or other data formats, are processed by OpenAI in order to develop machine learning models. This data is then used to improve or train the respective tool.

OpenAI collects the IP address when a tool is used. If the respective tool is not filled with personal data, no personal data other than the IP address is collected.

OpenAI can set cookies. This is only done with prior consent. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.

Otherwise, the legal basis for the processing of data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in using the possibilities of AI and ML models in our tools and integrating them on our website in order to optimize our service technically and economically.

If the function to automatically delete the chat history is not activated, the data entered will remain with OpenAI for 30 days in order to train the models.

In the case of data transfer to the USA, the standard contractual clauses (SCC) of the EU Commission apply.

#### 3.11.7\[...\]

### 3.12 Cloud backups

We use cloud backup functions on our website to protect the data and content of the website from data loss, corruption or security incidents. This ensures that the website can be restored quickly and completely in the event of a server failure, a hacker attack or other unforeseen events.

If personal data is stored on our website, it is transferred to the servers of the respective provider during backups. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, as we have a legitimate interest in backing up our data.

We use the following cloud backup service:

## 4. This is also important

Finally, we would like to inform you in detail about your rights and how you will be informed about changes in data protection requirements.

### 4.1 Yours Rights in detail

#### 4.1.1 Right to information according to Art. 15 GDPR

You can request information about whether your personal data is being processed. If this is the case, you can request further information about the type and manner of processing. A detailed list can be found in Art. 15 (1) a) to h) GDPR.

#### 4.1.2 Right to rectification according to Art. 16 GDPR

This right includes the correction of inaccurate data and the completion of incomplete personal data.

#### 4.1.3 Right to deletion according to Art. 17 GDPR

This so-called 'right to be forgotten' gives you the right, under certain conditions, to demand the deletion of personal data by the controller. This is generally the case if the purpose of the data processing has ceased to exist, if consent has been revoked or if the initial processing took place without a legal basis. You can find a detailed list of reasons in Art. 17 (1) lit. a to f GDPR. Furthermore, this "right to be forgotten" corresponds with the obligation of the controller under Art. 17 (2) GDPR to take appropriate measures to bring about a general erasure of the data.

#### 4.1.4 Right to restriction of processing according to Art. 18 GDPR

This right is subject to the conditions set out in Art. 18(1)(a) to (d).

#### 4.1.5 Right to data portability according to Art. 20 GDPR

Here, the basic right to receive one's own data in a common form and to transfer it to another data controller is regulated. However, this only applies to data processed on the basis of consent or a contract pursuant to Art. 20 (1) (a) and (b) and to the extent that this is technically feasible.

#### 4.1.6 Right of objection according to Art. 21 GDPR

In principle, you can object to the processing of your personal data. This applies in particular if your interest in objecting outweighs the legitimate interest of the controller in the processing and if the processing relates to direct marketing and/or profiling.

#### 4.1.7 Right to "decision in individual cases" according to Art. 22 GDPR

In principle, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (including profiling) which produces legal effects vis-à-vis you or similarly significantly affects you. However, this right is also subject to restrictions and additions in Art. 22 (2) and (4) GDPR.

#### 4.1.8 Other rights

The GDPR contains comprehensive rights to inform third parties about whether or how you have asserted rights under Art. 16, 17, 18 GDPR. However, this only applies insofar as this is possible or feasible with reasonable effort.

At this point, we would like to inform you once again of your right to withdraw your consent in accordance with Article 7 (3) of the GDPR. However, this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out up to that point.

In addition, we would like to inform you about your rights according to §§ 32 ff. BDSG, which, however, are largely congruent with the rights just described.

#### 4.1.9 Right of appeal according to Art. 77 GDPR

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes this Regulation.

## 5. What if tomorrow the GDPR is abolished or other changes take place?

The current status of this Privacy Policy is 23.03.2025. From time to time it is necessary to adapt the content of the Privacy Policy in order to react to actual and legal changes. We therefore reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time. We will publish the amended version in the same place and recommend that you read the Privacy Policy regularly.
