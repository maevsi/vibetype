# Privacy policy

## 1\. Introduction

This website is operated by: maevsi UG (haftungsbeschränkt).

It is very important to us to handle the data of our website visitors confidentially and to protect it in the best possible way. For this reason, we make every effort to meet the requirements of the GDPR.

Below we explain how we process your data on our website. We use the clearest and most transparent language possible so that you really understand what happens to your data.

## 2\. General information

### 2.1 Processing of personal data and other terms

Data protection applies to the processing of personal data. Personal data means all data with which you can be personally identified. This is, for example, the IP address of the device (PC, laptop, smartphone, etc.) you are currently using. Such data is processed when 'something happens to it'. Here, for example, the IP is transmitted from the browser to our provider and automatically stored there. This is then a processing (according to Art. 4 No. 2 GDPR) of personal data (according to Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR).

These and other legal definitions can be found in Art. 4 GDPR.

### 2.2 Applicable regulations/laws - GDPR, BDSG and TDDDG

The scope of data protection is regulated by law. In this case, these are the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) as a European regulation and the BDSG (Federal Data Protection Act) as a national law.

In addition, the TDDDG supplements the provisions of the GDPR as far as the use of cookies is concerned.

### 2.3 The controller(s)

The controller within the meaning of the GDPR is responsible for data processing on this website. This is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.

You can contact the controller at:

maevsi UG (limited liability)

Virchowstraße 4 34121 Kassel

contact+privacy-policy@maev.si

### 2.4 How data is generally processed on this website

As we have already established, some data (e.g. IP address) is collected automatically. This data is mainly required for the technical provision of the website. If we also use personal data or collect other data, we will inform you of this or ask for your consent.

You provide us with other personal data consciously.

You will find detailed information on this below.

### 2.5 Your rights

The GDPR provides you with comprehensive rights. These include, for example, free information about the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal data. You can also request the rectification, blocking or erasure of this data or lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority. You can withdraw your consent at any time.

You can find out what these rights look like in detail and how to exercise them in the last section of this privacy policy.

### 2.6 Data protection - our view

Data protection is more than just a chore for us! Personal data has great value and careful handling of this data should be a matter of course in our digitalized world. As a website visitor, you should also be able to decide for yourself what “happens” to your data, when and by whom. We therefore undertake to comply with all legal provisions, collect only the data that is necessary for us and, of course, treat it confidentially.

### 2.7 Disclosure and deletion

The transfer and deletion of data are also important and sensitive issues. We would therefore like to briefly inform you in advance about our general approach to this.

Data is only passed on on the basis of a legal basis and only if this is unavoidable. This may be the case in particular if we are dealing with a so-called processor and an order processing contract has been concluded in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR.

We delete your data when the purpose and legal basis for processing no longer apply and the deletion does not conflict with any other legal obligations. Art. 17 GDPR also provides a 'good' overview of this.

For further information, please refer to this privacy policy and contact the controller if you have any specific questions.

### 2.8 Hosting

This website is hosted externally. The personal data collected on this website is stored on the host's servers. This includes the automatically collected and stored log files (see below for more details), as well as all other data provided by website visitors.

External hosting is carried out for the purpose of secure, fast and reliable provision of our website and in this context serves to fulfill the contract with our potential and existing customers.

The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, b and f GDPR, as well as § 25 para. 1 TDDDG, insofar as consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the end device of the website visitor or user within the meaning of the TDDDG.

Our hoster only processes data that is required to fulfill its performance obligation and acts as our processor, i.e. it is subject to our instructions. We have concluded a corresponding contract for order processing with our hoster.

We use the following hoster:

Hetzner

Hetzner Online GmbH, Industriestr. 25, 91710 Gunzenhausen, Germany.

[](https://www.hetzner.com/de/rechtliches/datenschutz)[https://www.hetzner.com/de/rechtliches/datenschutz](https://www.hetzner.com/de/rechtliches/datenschutz).

### 2.9 Legal bases

The processing of personal data always requires a legal basis. The GDPR provides for the following possibilities in Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1:

(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her for one or more specific purposes;

b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract

c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject

d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person

e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller

f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller(s) or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

In the following sections, we will provide you with the specific legal basis for the respective processing.

### 3.5 Analysis and tracking tools

#### 3.5.1 Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics on this website. Google Analytics is a web analysis service. This service is provided by Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.

Google Analytics uses cookies to recognize the user and thus analyze usage behavior. These cookies are only set with consent. Consent can be revoked at any time and managed in our cookie consent tool.

The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TDDDG.

The information collected here is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision for the USA. Google LLC is certified under the EU-US Privacy Framework. However, as the Google servers are located worldwide and data transfer to third countries (e.g. Singapore) cannot be ruled out, the EU Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) apply.

The use of Google Analytics results in IP anonymization. The IP address of the respective user is shortened on servers within the member states of the EU (or the European Economic Area) in such a way that it is no longer possible to trace it back to a natural person. In addition, Google undertakes to provide appropriate data protection via the Google Ads data processing conditions and creates an evaluation of website use and website activity and provides the services associated with use. The Google Ads Data Processing Terms apply to companies that are subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Economic Area (EEA), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) or similar regulations.

An additional browser plugin can be used to prevent the information collected (such as the IP address) from being sent to Google and used by Google. You can find the plugin and further information on this at [](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de)[https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de).

Otherwise, the storage period depends on the type of data processed. Each customer can choose how long Google Analytics stores data before it is automatically deleted. The maximum lifespan of a Google Analytics cookie is two years.

Further information on data usage by Google can also be found at [](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de)[https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de). For all other queries, you can also contact [support-deutschland@google.com](mailto:support-deutschland@google.com) directly.

#### 3.5.2 Google Consent Mode

We use Google Consent Mode on our website to customize the use of Google services based on your consent. This means that, depending on your consent, we either use the full functionality of these services or only carry out limited data collection.

Google Consent Mode allows a certain amount of data processing, even if consent is denied, but in anonymized form.

We use the basic consent mode. This allows us to continue to collect aggregated data even if you have not consented to certain cookies. IP addresses may be transmitted to Google. The processing serves to improve our website and to analyze conversion events in anonymized form. This enables us to better assess the performance of our marketing measures.

The processing is carried out in our legitimate interest in being able to better control and use certain functions of the Google services used on the website that require consent. The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.

Further information on Google Consent Mode can be found at: [https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9976101.](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9976101.)

#### 3.5.3 Sentry

We integrate the Sentry service on our website. This is a service provided by Functional Software, Inc, Hawthorne St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.

Sentry collects and stores data created from anonymized usage profiles in order to improve the technical stability of our website by monitoring system stability and identifying code errors. According to the service, user data, such as information on the device or time of error, is collected anonymously and is not used for personal purposes and is subsequently deleted.

Sentry may set cookies to track activity on our website and store certain information. These cookies help us to operate the service, store your preferences and keep our website secure.

The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TDDDG, insofar as this consent includes access to information in the user's terminal device or the storage of cookies within the meaning of the TDDDG.

Otherwise, the legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in the anonymized analysis to ensure the technical stability of our website.

#### 3.5.4 Cloudflare Web Analytics

We integrate the Cloudflare Web Analytics service on our website. This is a service provided by Cloudflare Germany GmbH, Rosental 7, c/o Mindspace, 80331 Munich, Germany.

Cloudflare Web Analytics enables us to obtain important statistics about the use of the website. It enables us to retrieve the most important host names, URLs, countries and other important key figures such as status codes. In addition, traffic peaks can be analyzed.

Cloudflare does not use any client-side information that is collected using cookies or localStorage, for example.

Various data is processed, including information on website performance, clicks, accesses and technical errors that occur on the website. The purpose of data processing is to improve search engine optimization (SEO), analyze the technical performance of the website and correct errors.

The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, as we have a legitimate interest in optimizing our website in the search results and ensuring its functionality.

Google Search Console does not set cookies on our website. However, data may be transferred to third countries, in particular to the USA, as Google operates servers worldwide. The standard contractual clauses (SCCs) of the EU Commission are used to ensure an adequate level of data protection.

The data is stored for as long as it is necessary for the respective processing purpose or until the user requests its deletion.

Further information on data processing can be found at: [](null)[https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

b) Page insights

LinkedIn provides us with summarized statistics and insights (so-called Page Insights) that give us information about how people interact with our company page. Among other things, we receive information about the number of profiles that view, comment on or otherwise interact with our posts, as well as aggregated demographic and other information that helps us learn about the interaction with our page or LinkedIn profile. Pages Insights provided to us by LinkedIn consist of aggregated data, and LinkedIn does not provide us with any personally identifiable information about members in relation to Page Insights. We also have no way of linking Page Insights to individual members.

When placing ads, LinkedIn provides us with information about the types of people who see our ads and about the success of our ads. Personal data is only passed on to us if this person has consented to such processing. We also receive information from LinkedIn that enables us to understand which of our ads led to a purchase being made or an action being taken.

This data is processed for the purpose of analyzing our reach and adapting our content and ads to user interests.

#### 3.7.2 Page Insights

As explained in the Meta Privacy Policy under “How do we use your information?” (explained), Meta also collects and uses information to provide analytics services, so-called Page Insights, for page operators. This also applies to our Facebook page.

Page Insights are aggregated statistics that are generated and logged by Meta servers based on certain visitor interactions with pages and the content associated with them (e.g. viewing a page or video, subscribing to a page, “liking” or “unliking” a page, etc.).

Meta provides us with summarized statistics and insights in connection with the Page Insights, which give us information about how people interact with our company website. We do not have access to any personal data, only to the summarized Page Insights. With the help of Page Insights, we can view anonymous statistics, e.g. the reach of our account, page views, likes, etc.. These also contain evaluations according to the age, gender and location of the users (as specified by them in their respective Facebook profiles). To evaluate the reach, we can make settings or set appropriate filters with regard to the selection of a time period, the viewing of a specific post and demographic groupings. This data is anonymized. It is not possible for us to draw conclusions about specific individuals.

The purpose of processing this data is to analyze our reach and adapt our content and advertisements to user interests so that visitors can derive the greatest possible benefit from them. By evaluating this data, we can recognize how our content, our profile and our advertising are consumed. This enables us to create target-group-specific content and place advertising to better market our company and our services.

#### 3.7.3 Processing of personal data and cookies by Meta

When you access a Facebook page, the IP address assigned to your end device is transmitted to Facebook. According to Facebook, this IP address is anonymized (for “German” IP addresses). Facebook also stores information about the end devices of its users (e.g. as part of the “login notification” function); Facebook may thus be able to assign IP addresses to individual users. If you are currently logged in to Facebook as a user, a cookie with your Facebook ID is stored on your device. This enables Facebook to track that you have visited this page and how you have used it. Facebook buttons integrated into websites enable Facebook to record your visits to these websites and assign them to your Facebook profile. This data can be used to tailor content or advertising to you.

Information on how personal data can be managed or deleted can be found in Facebook's Privacy Center:

[https://www.facebook.com/privacy/center/.](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/center/.)

Through interactions such as liking or sharing, we can see the user profile with the public information.

The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. It is in our legitimate interest to provide relevant and interesting content and to enable the use and functionality of our Instagram profile.

Insofar as an inquiry is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, our processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.

#### 3.8.2 Insights

As explained in the meta privacy policy under “How do we use your information?” ([https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?entry\_point=ig\_help\_center\_data\_policy\_redirect)](https://privacycenter.instagram.com/policy/?entry_point=ig_help_center_data_policy_redirect)), Meta also collects and uses information to provide analytics services, so-called insights, for site operators. This also applies to our Instagram profile.

Insights are summarized statistics that are created based on certain interactions of visitors with pages and the content associated with them and are logged by the Meta servers. This includes the following information, among others

- How many people see and interact with our products, services or content, such as posts, videos, Instagram pages, listings, stores and advertisements (if the advertisement is shown on Meta products);

- How people interact with our content, websites, apps and services;

- Which group of people interact with our content and which group of people use our services.

Meta provides us with aggregated reports and insights that tell us how well our content, features, products and services are performing.

We do not have access to personal data, but only to the summarized reports.

To evaluate the reach, we can make settings or set appropriate filters with regard to the selection of a time period, the viewing of a specific post and demographic groupings. This data is anonymized. It is not possible for us to draw conclusions about specific individuals.

The purpose of processing this data is to analyze our reach and to adapt our content and advertisements to user interests so that visitors can derive the greatest possible benefit from them. By evaluating this data, we can recognize how our content, our profile and our advertising are consumed. This enables us to create target-group-specific content and place advertising in order to better market our company and our services.

The processing is based on our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.

When processing personal data in the course of the so-called Insights, the processing is carried out in joint responsibility with Meta in accordance with Art. 26 para. 1 GDPR.

For this purpose, we have entered into a corresponding agreement with Meta, which can be viewed here ([https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page\_controller\_addendum.)](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum.)).

Meta's contact details are as follows:

Processing of personal data and cookies by Meta

When you access an Instagram page, the IP address assigned to your device is transmitted to Meta. According to Meta, this IP address is anonymized (for “German” IP addresses). Meta also stores information about the end devices of its users (e.g. as part of the “login notification” function); Meta may thus be able to assign IP addresses to individual users. If you are currently logged in to Instagram as a user, a cookie with your Instagram ID is stored on your device. This enables Meta to track that you have visited this page and how you have used it. Meta buttons integrated into websites enable Meta to record your visits to these websites and assign them to your Instagram profile. This data can be used to tailor content or advertising to you.

### 3.10 Google company profile

We have a so-called Google company profile. We use the information service offered by Google and the services of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (“Google”).

#### 3.10.1 Data processing by Google

The Google site and its functions are used under your own responsibility. This applies in particular to the use of social and interactive functions (e.g. commenting, sharing, rating, direct messages). When you visit and interact with our Google company profile entry, Google also records your IP address and other information that is stored on your device in the form of cookies. This may enable Google to assign IP addresses to individual users or user accounts. This information is used to provide us, as the operator of the Google company profile entry, with statistical information about the use of Google services. The data collected in this context is processed by Google and may be transferred to countries outside the European Union. What information Google receives and how it is used is generally described by Google in its privacy policy.

If you contact us via our Google company profile entry or other Google services by direct message, we cannot rule out the possibility that these messages may also be read and analyzed by Google (both by employees and automatically). We therefore advise against providing us with personal data. Instead, another form of communication should be chosen as early as possible.

The use of this service is subject to the Google Privacy Policy, which you - by using it - have already agreed to.

Further information can be found in the privacy policy at the following link: [](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de.)[https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de.](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de.)

#### 3.10.2 Data processing by us

As the provider of our Google company profile entry, we do not collect and process any further data from the use of this Google service.

If you contact us or publish a review about us, we process your published profile data and the content of the review/comment.

The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in presenting our company and enabling the evaluation of our services in order to present our company and our services to the outside world.

### 3.11 Third-party content

#### 3.11.1 Google Fonts

We have integrated Google Fonts locally on our server. This means that no data is transferred to Google despite use.

#### 3.11.2 Cloudflare DNS

We use the Cloudflare DNS service. This service is offered by Cloudflare Germany GmbH, Rosental 7, c/o Mindspace, 80331 Munich, Germany.

Cloudflare DNS offers protection against DDoS attacks and bot attacks and helps to improve the security and performance of websites through global caching and a range of optimization functions. For this purpose, Cloudflare receives data on the website accessed, the browser type used, the operating system, the referrer URL, the IP address and the requesting provider.

We obtain consent to collect this data. The legal basis is then Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. This consent can be withdrawn at any time.

Otherwise, the legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in optimizing and securing the content on our website in order to effectively protect ourselves against DDoS attacks and bot attacks.

#### 3.11.3 Cloudflare Turnstile

We use the Cloudflare Turnstile service. This service is offered by Cloudflare Germany GmbH, Rosental 7, c/o Mindspace, 80331 Munich, Germany.

Cloudflare Turnstile enables a CAPTCHA-free experience on the website. In addition, Turnstile prevents misuse and confirms that the website views are genuine. No data is collected for the retargeting of advertisements. For Apple devices with the latest macOS or iOS versions, validation is performed via private access tokens without collecting or storing any personal data other than user agent and browser properties, which means that no data is passed on to Cloudflare or third parties. For users of other end devices, however, Cloudflare Turnstile collects personal data such as the IP address and shares it with the provider in the USA.

The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time.

#### 3.11.4 Polyfill.io

We use the functions of Polyfill. This is an open source community service.

The Polyfill service provides code snippets, so-called “polyfills”. A polyfill is used to implement modern functions in older web browsers that they did not originally support using alternative solutions. This provides a uniform experience when visiting the website across different browsers.

When our website is accessed, the browser downloads all the polyfills required to successfully display the website in the browser in question.

Technical information about the browser used is collected for this purpose. In addition, connection information is recorded (IP address) and the URL of the website that requested the service. This information is not stored. However, an anonymized version of your IP address, the domain of the page that requested the service, the user agent string of the browser used, the polyfills requested and the URL/http method used to request the service are stored. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in making the site accessible for older web browsers. Further information: [](https://polyfill.io/v3/privacy-policy)[https://polyfill.io/v3/privacy-policy](https://polyfill.io/v3/privacy-policy).

#### 3.11.5 Gravatar

We integrate the functions of Gravatar on our website. This service is offered by Automattic Inc, 60 29th Street #343, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA.

Gravatar is a service that allows users to create a single avatar image and link it to their email address. This avatar image is then automatically displayed next to the name when comments are posted or articles are written on Gravatar-enabled websites, forums and blogs. Gravatar's main features include the easy creation and management of a universal avatar that is used consistently across different web platforms, making it easier to identify users and maintain a consistent online identity across multiple sites.

For this purpose, the e-mail address and IP address are transmitted to Automattic's servers in the USA. Gravatar sets technically necessary cookies as well as cookies for analysis, performance measurement and advertising. The latter are only set with consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. Consent can be revoked at any time.

Otherwise, data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in giving users the opportunity to use the Gravatar functions on our website in order to ensure an unrestricted user experience.

The EU Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) apply to data transfers to the USA.

#### 3.11.6 OpenAI API

We integrate the functions of the OpenAI API on our website. This service is offered by OpenAI Inc, 3180 18th Street, San Francisco, California 94110, USA.

OpenAI has focused on the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning. With the help of the OpenAI API, we are able to develop our own AI tools based on the databases and capabilities of ChatGPT/OpenAI.

All inputs in our tool are processed. Basically, these inputs, e.g. natural language, images or other data formats, are processed by OpenAI in order to develop machine learning models. This data is then used to improve or train the respective tool.

OpenAI collects the IP address when a tool is used. If the respective tool is not filled with personal data, no personal data other than the IP address is collected.

OpenAI can set cookies. This is only done with prior consent. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.

Otherwise, the legal basis for the processing of data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in using the possibilities of AI and ML models in our tools and integrating them on our website in order to optimize our service technically and economically.

If the function to automatically delete the chat history is not activated, the data entered will remain with OpenAI for 30 days in order to train the models.

The EU Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) apply to data transfers to the USA.

#### 3.11.7 \[...\]

### 3.12 Cloud backups

We use cloud backup functions on our website to protect the data and content of the website from data loss, corruption or security incidents. This ensures that the website can be restored quickly and completely in the event of a server failure, a hacker attack or other unforeseen events.

If personal data is stored on our website, it is transferred to the servers of the respective provider during backups. The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, as we have a legitimate interest in backing up our data.

We use the following cloud backup service:

## 4\. What else is important

Finally, we would like to inform you in detail about your rights and how you will be informed about changes to data protection requirements.

### 4.1 Your rights in detail

#### 4.1.1 Right to information in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR

You can request information about whether your personal data is being processed. If this is the case, you can request further information on the type and manner of processing. A detailed list can be found in Art. 15 para. 1 lit. a to h GDPR.

#### 4.1.2 Right to rectification pursuant to Art. 16 GDPR

This right includes the rectification of inaccurate data and the completion of incomplete personal data.

#### 4.1.3 Right to erasure pursuant to Art. 17 GDPR

This so-called 'right to be forgotten' gives you the right, under certain conditions, to request the erasure of personal data by the controller. This is generally the case if the purpose of the data processing no longer applies, if consent has been withdrawn or the initial processing took place without a legal basis. A detailed list of reasons can be found in Art. 17 para. 1 lit. a to f GDPR. This “right to be forgotten” also corresponds to the controller's obligation under Art. 17 para. 2 GDPR to take reasonable measures to bring about the general erasure of data.

#### 4.1.4 Right to restriction of processing pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR

This right is subject to the conditions set out in Art. 18 para. 1 lit. a to d.

#### 4.1.5 Right to data portability pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR

This regulates the basic right to receive your own data in a commonly used form and to transmit it to another controller. However, this only applies to data processed on the basis of consent or a contract in accordance with Art. 20 (1) (a) and (b) and insofar as this is technically feasible.

#### 4.1.6 Right to object pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR

In principle, you can object to the processing of your personal data. This applies in particular if your interest in objecting outweighs the legitimate interest of the controller in the processing and if the processing relates to direct marketing and/or profiling.

#### 4.1.7 Right to “individual decision-making” pursuant to Art. 22 GDPR

In principle, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (including profiling) which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. However, this right is also subject to restrictions and additions in Art. 22 (2) and (4) GDPR.

#### 4.1.8 Further rights

The GDPR includes comprehensive rights to inform third parties whether or how you have asserted rights under Art. 16, 17, 18 GDPR. However, this is only possible or feasible with reasonable effort.

At this point, we would like to draw your attention once again to your right to withdraw your consent in accordance with Art. 7 (3) GDPR. However, this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out up to that point.

We would also like to draw your attention to your rights under Sections 32 et seq. BDSG, which, however, are largely congruent with the rights just described.

#### 4.1.9 Right to lodge a complaint pursuant to Art. 77 GDPR

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes this Regulation.

## 5\. What if the GDPR is abolished tomorrow or other changes take place?

The current status of this Privacy Policy is 23.03.2025. From time to time it is necessary to adapt the content of the Privacy Policy to respond to factual and legal changes. We therefore reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time. We will publish the amended version in the same place and recommend that you read the privacy policy regularly.
