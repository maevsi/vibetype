# VIBETYPE Code of Conduct

At VIBETYPE, the vibe comes first – and good vibes need clear boundaries.
We aim to promote a harmonious and safe digital community – **both online in the app and at in-person events that the app facilitates.** This Code of Conduct is here to ensure that everyone feels respected and enjoys being part of the experience.
**All community members are expected to follow these rules.** Violations can lead to **account suspension or removal**.

This isn’t some boring rulebook – it’s our collective **manifesto for good vibes**.

> **💡 Pro Tip:** If you’re posting or planning something and think: “Hmm… is this okay?” Do a quick vibe check: If you wouldn’t show it to your grandma, better not post it.

When in doubt, ask yourself whether your content is **appropriate for all age groups** and **useful or interesting to others.**
Ask yourself: Would you say it **face-to-face** to someone? If not, better not post it.

## Data Protection & Safety

> **✅ Privacy is like your DJ booth:** Only you decide who gets access.
So: Don’t pass around other people’s data. Not cool.

- **Protecting Privacy:** Handle personal data with care – both your own and that of others.
**Do not share private information** about others (e.g., full names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, or personal photos) without their explicit consent.
**Doxxing** (publishing sensitive personal data) is strictly prohibited.

- **Using Privacy Settings:** Our app offers settings that let you share certain profile details or posts with just friends/participants.
Use them if you want to limit visibility.
Also, respect others’ privacy settings – for example, if an event is marked *private*, treat the information shared there as confidential.

- **Mind Your Own Data:** Be mindful about what personal details you share on the platform.
Remember that anything you post publicly can be seen by others.
Use profile settings to keep sensitive information private.

- **Don’t Share Others’ Info (Photos & People):** If you upload event photos where other people are clearly recognizable, make sure they’ve **agreed** to it.
Respect personal rights: no one should appear on VIBETYPE against their will or be tagged without consent.

- **Account Security:** Protect your account with a strong password and never share your login details with others.
You are responsible for all activity under your account.
If you notice unauthorized access or suspicious behavior, **report it immediately to the VIBETYPE team via: <https://forms.monday.com/forms/74204ae8168ecb1dd44c15b502854a5a?r=euc1>.**

- **Don’t Endanger Others:** Don’t put anyone at risk through your behavior.
For example, the app may **not be used to promote challenges or content** that encourages dangerous actions.
Think about the consequences before posting something others might copy.
Safety > virality.

- **Plan Safe Meetups:** The app makes it easy to connect and meet at events.
If you plan to meet people through the app (outside of official events), always choose **public places** and let friends or family know where you’ll be.
This is more of a *personal safety tip* than a rule, but we strongly recommend it.
At official events, organizers usually handle safety – follow their instructions.

- **Data Privacy Policies:** Follow applicable data protection laws and our privacy policy.
Do not collect or use other users’ data for unauthorized purposes (e.g., unsolicited contact or marketing outside the platform).
The privacy of our community is a top priority.

**💡 Reminder:** **Privacy and safety are a team effort.**
We provide the tools and rules – you, the user, should use them wisely.
Treat others’ privacy with the same care you expect for your own.

## Creating Events & Content

> **✅ Your event is your stage.** Keep it clean, honest & welcoming.

- **Honest and Clear Info:** When creating an event, provide **accurate and clear information** (title, date, location, description, etc.).
Do not mislead participants – they deserve to know what to expect.
Be transparent and clear about the event’s purpose.

- **Appropriate Event Content:** Only post events that align with our community values.
**Events that promote violence, hate, illegal activities, or discrimination** are not allowed.
Also make sure event titles and descriptions use respectful language – avoid vulgar or offensive terms.

- **Photos & Media:** Choose event and profile images that follow the guidelines.
Do not upload media containing **violent, sexually explicit, or offensive** content.
Only share media you have the rights to use (see **Copyright** above) and that doesn’t violate anyone’s privacy or dignity.

- **No Unauthorized Advertising:** Don’t use events just as a cover for advertising or commercial purposes unrelated to the community vibe.
If your event is sponsored or has a commercial aspect, be transparent and make sure it offers real value to the community – not just spam.

- **Feedback and Reviews:** When rating events or giving feedback, be fair and objective.
**Constructive criticism is welcome**, but it must be expressed respectfully.
Nobody likes unjustified negative reviews or personal attacks disguised as “feedback.”
Focus on the content, not the person.

## Behavior at In-Person Events

> **✅ Online vibes?** Then stay respectful offline too.
Leave events – and people – better than you found them.

- **Respect On Site:** VIBETYPE values apply **offline** just as much as online.
Treat fellow event participants with the same respect and kindness you’d show in the app.
Being punctual, reliable, and greeting others with a smile shows appreciation.
**Harassment, discrimination, or aggressive behavior** will not be tolerated in any setting.

- **Follow Rules & Laws:** Respect the **venue rules and local laws.**
Don’t bring prohibited items to events (e.g., weapons, drugs) and follow any house rules or terms set by event organizers.
If an event has specific guidelines (like a dress code or age restriction), respect them.

- **Safety & Well-Being:** Look out for your **own safety** and that of others.
Respect personal boundaries – physical contact or photos are only okay if **everyone involved consents**.
If you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, step away and reach out to the event organizers or the VIBETYPE team.
And if you see someone being harassed or endangered, speak up or get help (without putting yourself at risk).

- **Personal Responsibility:** Own your behavior at events.
Be honest and reliable – if you sign up, do your best to show up or cancel in good time.
Leave the venue as you'd like to find it.
Remember: as a VIBETYPE community member, your **offline actions** also reflect on the community as a whole.

- **Follow-Up:** If problems arise during an event (conflicts, code of conduct violations, safety issues), report them to the VIBETYPE team afterward.
We take such reports seriously and aim to make future events safer and better for everyone.

## Enforcement & Consequences

> **✅ Don’t want drama?** Stick to the rules.

- **Reporting Violations:** If you see content or behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, **report it** to the VIBETYPE team.
Reporting tools are available in the app.
Everyone plays a part in keeping the community safe by flagging harmful content or events.

- **Review & Moderation:** The VIBETYPE team reviews reports and may take appropriate action if rules are broken.
**Content may be removed** or edited if it goes against the guidelines.
Likewise, events may be canceled or profile elements adjusted to protect the community.

- **Warnings & Bans:** Depending on the severity, violations may result in warnings or **immediate consequences**.
Minor offenses might lead to a warning or request to change behavior.
**Serious or repeated violations** can result in temporary or permanent **account bans**.
In extreme cases (e.g., criminal activity, threats, harassment), an **immediate permanent ban** may be issued without prior warning.

- **Legal Action:** Illegal actions – such as credible threats of violence, sharing abusive material, or encouraging criminal activity – can be reported to **the relevant authorities** in addition to resulting in a ban.
Protecting our community comes first.

- **No Circumventing Action:** Don’t try to bypass moderation measures.
Banned users may not create new accounts without permission.
Attempts to get around these rules can result in further action.

Thanks to all who take it seriously and help build a **friendly, safe environment**.
If you have questions or concerns about the rules, reach out to the VIBETYPE team.
We’re here for you – let’s build something great together.

## Final Words

> **✅** Keep it real.
Keep it safe.
**Keep it vibin'.**

VIBETYPE is about fun, connection, and shared experiences.
By sticking to this Code of Conduct, we make sure **everyone has a good time**, both on the platform and at events.
Thank you for being part of our community and helping to create a **safe and positive vibe**!

**Important:** These steps are **guidelines**.
In some cases, the moderation team may act differently if special circumstances apply.
For example, a severe first-time violation could result in a permanent ban if that’s what it takes to protect the community.
Likewise, minor issues will be handled with fairness and discretion.
Our **Trust & Safety team follows internal policies** and uses best judgment – similar to platforms like Discord, where staff can issue warnings, remove content, or suspend accounts depending on severity.
