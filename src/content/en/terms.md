**§ 1 Overview of the Functions and Purposes of the VIBETYPE Platform**

(1) The platform provides natural and legal persons and partnerships (hereinafter "users") with the online service "VIBETYPE."
It is a platform that can be used both through the website and a corresponding mobile app.
Through the platform, users can create and share events, as well as offer and sell tickets for the event.
Furthermore, users can view events posted by other users on the platform and, as a guest, purchase tickets for participation in events at the conditions offered by the organizer.
The platform merely acts as a technical service provider.
It provides the technology through which users can create events and offer participation in them (by selling tickets), and through which users who are searching for events can contact users offering events and purchase tickets for an event.
VIBETYPE itself is not an organizer or a ticket provider for participation in events.
Contracts regarding events or participation in them are concluded exclusively directly between the users in their role as organizer and/or guest.
The platform only provides access to the platform via the website and mobile app, as well as the features there, without itself becoming a contractual partner in contracts related to the organization and execution of events or participation in them.

(2) The provision of the app, website, and its features explicitly includes the fact that the platform suggests events to users based on their user behavior.
The service offered by the platform is intended to provide events and connect organizers with potential guests.
Additionally, the platform allows organizers to offer and sell tickets to guests and provides a function for processing purchases and communication between users.

(3) Only registered users with an appropriate user account can be organizers of events offered on "VIBETYPE."

(4) Products or services offered by users of the platform through the platform are neither provided by the platform itself nor by any companies under its supervision.
The platform itself is never the organizer of events offered on the platform.
All products or services offered on the platform are provided by the respective user who has posted or is offering them on the platform, in their own name.
The user offering the product or service is solely responsible for the product or service offered and the sole point of contact for any questions related to the product or service offered.

(5) If users enter into contracts with other users on the platform (for example, regarding the execution of events or regarding the purchase of tickets or participation in an event), the contractual relationships exist exclusively between the respective users (i.e., the organizers and guests).
The platform is neither the user's representative nor a contracting party.
It is also not acting as an intermediary for a commission.

(6) Details on the scope of functions and usage possibilities of the platform for registered users can be found in § 3 of these terms of use.

**§ 2 Registration and Creation of a User Account**

(1) To use the platform, you must register as a user in our app or on our website and create a user account (user profile).

(2) The user account consists of a username and a password ("login data").
The creation of a user account is only possible by providing a current email address that the user has unrestricted access to.
This email address also serves for communication between us as the platform and the user.

(3) The use of the platform and the creation of a user account is only allowed for natural persons who are of legal age.

(4) The user is obliged to handle the login data carefully.
In particular, the user is prohibited from sharing the login data with third parties and/or allowing third parties to access the user data or the user account by bypassing the login data.

(5) If a user violates the obligations under the previous paragraph (4) and their user account is used by third parties, the user is liable for all activities that occur under their user account.
The user is not liable if they are not responsible for the misuse of their user account.
If a user becomes aware of the misuse of their user data or user account, they are obliged to report it to the platform immediately.

(6) The user guarantees that the data used when creating their profile ("profile data") is accurate and complete.

(7) Registered users who are not consumers are required to maintain an imprint in their user profile that complies with legal requirements.

  Participation in private events is only possible for individuals invited by the organizer using the platform's invitation function.
  Participation is generally not open to everyone unless the person purchases a ticket.

  Organizers can limit the number of available tickets and attach further conditions or make ticket purchases dependent on certain requirements.
- **Participation in Public Events and Ticket Purchase**: Participation in public events as a guest requires that the user meets the conditions set by the organizer and, if required by the organizer, has purchased a ticket to attend the event.

(2) The reporting user must sufficiently justify the report of the illegality of the content and provide the content to the platform, for example, by submitting the precise URL where the content can be accessed. At the same time, the report must include a declaration from the reporting user about the accuracy and completeness of the information contained in the report.

**§ 8 Warranty and Indemnity Claim**

(1) The user guarantees that they are the sole owner of all necessary rights to the content they upload, post, or make available on the platform (e.g., texts, photos, videos, etc.) and that they have the rights to use this content on the platform and by the platform operator, and that the use of this content on and through the platform does not violate third-party rights (e.g., copyright, trademark rights, personal rights, etc.).
If the content was not created by the user themselves, they guarantee that they have acquired all necessary rights from the relevant rights holders for its use.

(2) The user indemnifies the platform and its employees or agents in the event of claims made due to alleged or actual legal violations and/or violations of third-party rights arising from actions taken by the user in connection with the use of the platform, for which the user is responsible.

Reimbursable costs also include those for reasonable legal defense.

(3) The user is obliged to support the platform in case the platform is involved in a claim due to alleged violations of rights by third parties, providing documents and evidence of their ownership of rights or rights acquisition, and submitting any necessary declarations.

**§ 9 Liability and Limitation of Liability**

(1) The content published by users in the app or on the website does not represent the opinion of the platform, and the platform generally does not check these contents for legality, accuracy, and completeness without cause.

(2) The platform assumes no liability regarding the information provided by users about created or shared events (e.g., location, date, time, costs, lineup, participation conditions, ticket prices, etc.).
In particular, the platform does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of the information or the execution of the event.
The platform also assumes no liability for last-minute changes and/or cancellations of events or for the user’s eligibility to participate.

(4) The platform is not liable for contractual claims arising from event contracts between organizing users and participating users.

(5) The platform is liable according to the statutory provisions only for intent and gross negligence and in accordance with the Product Liability Act.
For minor negligence, the platform is liable for damages caused by the injury to life, body, or health.

(6) In all other cases, the following limited liability applies: In the case of minor negligence, the platform is only liable for the violation of a material contractual obligation, the fulfillment of which is essential for the proper execution of the contract and on which the user can regularly rely.
The liability for minor negligence is limited to the damages that are foreseeable at the time of the conclusion of the contract and which typically arise.
This limitation of liability also applies to the platform’s agents.

(7) If the user, as a consumer, has statutory warranty rights against the platform, particularly concerning any defectiveness of digital products, these rights remain unaffected by the limitation of liability.

**§ 10 Data Protection**

The processing of the user’s personal data is carried out in accordance with the applicable data protection laws, in particular in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG).
To fulfill our information obligations, particularly regarding all information on the processing of personal data of users, we refer to our privacy policy.

**§ 11 Duration of Use, Termination, Deactivation, and Cancellation**

(1) The services or features of the platform specified in these Terms of Use under § 1 and § 3 can be used by registered users for an indefinite period, unless the platform changes the scope of functions, or a user account is blocked or restricted, or the user agreement or user account (user profile) is terminated.

(2) The user account (user profile) can be terminated by either party at any time without notice, without needing a reason.
A valid termination of the user profile by the user requires that the user has not set any future events.
If the user has set future events, a cancellation and deletion of the relevant event(s) is required before the termination of the profile can take place.

(3) In the case of a valid termination, the user will no longer have access to their user profile and the content they uploaded, events they created, and the data and information stored in their user profile, etc.
The user account will be deactivated upon termination, and the user will no longer be able to access the user account.
User data, content, and settings will be stored by VIBTYPE for one month.
During this period, the user has the opportunity to reactivate their user account with all user data, content, and settings.
If the user does not reactivate their account within this period, all profile and user account data, including content and settings, will be permanently deleted.

(4) The platform reserves the right to deactivate user accounts that have been inactive for at least 24 months, and subsequently irrevocably delete all data, content, and settings.
The platform will inform the user about the deactivation and the planned deletion in advance.
The user will then have the opportunity to prevent deletion by reactivating their account before it is deleted.
After successful reactivation, the user can continue to use the platform without restrictions.

**§ 12 Right of Withdrawal**

A right of withdrawal for the consumer does not apply here according to § 312 para. 1a BGB.

**§ 13 Change of Terms of Use**

(1) The platform operator is entitled to change or supplement the provisions of these Terms of Use at any time with effect for the future, particularly if this is necessary due to legal or substantive or functional adjustments to the platform (website and/or app), for example, in the case of technical changes or adjustments to functions.

(2) A change or supplement will be announced to the user at least 30 days before it becomes effective via email, without the need to send the changed or supplemented terms individually or the entire new version of the terms. It suffices to inform the user about the changes or additions made.
The platform will provide a link in the announcement where the user can view the full revised Terms of Use.

(3) If the user does not object to the change or supplement within 30 days after the announcement of the change or supplement and continues to use the services, this will be considered as agreement to the change or supplement; the platform will specifically inform the user of this in the announcement.

**§ 14 Provision of Digital Products**

(1) If desired by the user, the platform will provide digital products in the form of an app free of charge.
The app can be downloaded for free from the relevant app stores and installed on mobile devices, and used after user registration.

(2) The use of the app is not mandatory, as the platform can also be accessed and used via the website.

(3) The personal data collected for registration with VIBTYPE or in the app will only be used for the purposes specified in § 1 and will not be disclosed, so §§ 327 ff. BGB according to § 327 para. 3 in conjunction with § 312 para. 1a S. 2 BGB do not apply.

(4) The platform reserves the right to make changes to the app to adjust or improve its functionality and to meet legal requirements and obligations.

(5) Even though §§ 327 ff. BGB do not apply, the platform will inform users about significant changes and temporary access and/or usage restrictions.

**§ 15 Final Provisions**

(1) If these Terms of Use contain invalid provisions, the validity of the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected.

(2) The services of the platform and the provision of the platform and its features are exclusively based on these Terms of Use.

(3) No oral side agreements exist. Changes and additions to the Terms of Use require written form to be effective.
The written form requirement can only be waived in writing.

(4) The Terms of Use and the contractual relationship between the platform and the users are exclusively governed by German law.

(5) The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with the contract is – unless agreed otherwise between the parties – the location of the platform, unless another jurisdiction is mandatorily required by law.
